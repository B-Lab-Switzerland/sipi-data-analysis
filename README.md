# Project: SIPI |Â Subproject: Analysis of beyond-GDP and beyond-profit metrics

## Introduction
The Swiss Impact & Prosperity Initiative (SIPI) is reimagining success for Switzerland. It goes beyond GDP and traditional business metrics, aligning economic vitality with societal well-being, ecological integrity, and long-term resilience. SIPI's vision is a Switzerland where prosperity is measured not only by financial growth, but by the resilience of communities, the health of ecosystems, and the inclusive opportunities that drive long-term value creation.

In this repository the code for analysis of existing beyond-GDP metrics is developed. The goal is to extract a small number of highly expressive, mutually minimally correlated metrics.

## Technical Instructions
### How to Build the Docker Image

1. Clone the github repository to your system.
2. If you have not already done so, download and install Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started/). If your working under MacOS or Windows, I recommend to use Docker Desktop.
3. Run docker (e.g. by launching docker desktop)
4. In your command line/terminal, check that docker runs properly by executing "docker version". You should see both Client and Server versions.
5. Cd into the project repository "sipi-data-analysis"
6. Build the docker image by running ```docker build -t sipi-data-analysis .```. You should now see how the system and python packages are being installed.

### How to run Jupyter Lab inside the Docker Image
The dockerfile exposes jupyter lab to the port 8888. Therefore, you can launch juypter lab by running

```docker run -p 8888:8888 sipi-data-analysis```

from inside the sipi-data-analysis project folder. In your command line/terminal you should now see jupyter running. In order to open jupyter lab in your browser just copy-paste the URL including the access token to a new browser tab.
